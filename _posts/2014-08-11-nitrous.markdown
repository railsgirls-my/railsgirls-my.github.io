# Nitrous.IO Quick Setup for Rails Girls 

*<a href="https://nitrous.io/" target="_blank">Nitrous.IO</a> is a cloud development box and text editor where you can write and run your code.*

For [Rails Girls App Tutorial](/app), we will be using Nitrous.IO Web IDE. For a more detailed tour of Nitrous.IO, check out their official documentation at [http://help.nitrous.io](http://help.nitrous.io)

## *1.*Signing up 

<a href="https://www.nitrous.io/" target="_blank">Sign up</a> for a Nitrous.IO account and await their confirmation email.

Click on the link in the email to activate your account.


## *2.*Create your first box

Upon a successful account signup, you'll be prompted to create your first Nitrous.IO box.

Select the `Ruby/Rails` template. Pick a name for your box, or let the wizard generate a random name for you. Do not provide a Github repository as we will be creating a [Rails app](/app) from scratch.

Click the `Create Box` button to proceed. The next step is optional; you can buy more N2O now or link your Nitrous.IO account to Github, Google and Twitter if you wish.

## *3.*Web IDE
Now that you have a freshly minted Nitrous.IO box, you are ready to start our [Rails Girls App tutorial](/app)! Before you do that though, take some time to read the text in `README.md` and explore the Web IDE a little.

In case you had logged out beforehand and are now logging back in, you can return to the Web IDE by finding your box on your Dashboard, and clicking on the `IDE` button.

Occasionally, you may find that your Nitrous box has stopped running. That is because Nitrous automatically kills off idle sessions. If that happens, click on the `Start` button to restart your box.

Nitrous.IO documentation also has a [general overview](http://help.nitrous.io/ide-general/) of the Web IDE. Check it out!
